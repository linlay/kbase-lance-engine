# kbase-lance-engine

`kbase-lance-engine` is the local LanceDB 0.30.0 sidecar used by the Go KBASE
runtime. It binds to loopback only, writes one JSON ready handshake to stdout,
and writes operational logs to stderr.

Required process environment:

- `KBASE_LANCE_TOKEN`: per-process bearer token (at least 32 characters).
- `KBASE_LANCE_PARENT_PID`: optional Go parent PID; the sidecar exits when the
  parent disappears.
- `KBASE_LANCE_ALLOWED_ROOTS`: optional platform path-list restricting accepted
  `storageDir` values.
- `KBASE_LANCE_LISTEN_ADDR`: optional loopback address, default `127.0.0.1:0`.
  `KBASE_LANCE_LISTEN` remains an accepted compatibility alias.

The first stdout line is:

```json
{"protocolVersion":1,"engineVersion":"1.0.0","lancedbVersion":"0.30.0","listenAddress":"127.0.0.1:54321"}
```

Every HTTP request requires `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. JSON fields use
camelCase. The endpoints are:

- `GET /v1/health`
- `POST /v1/generations/create`
- `POST /v1/generations/release`
- `POST /v1/generations/import`
- `POST /v1/generations/validate`
- `POST /v1/indexes/build`
- `POST /v1/chunks/replace-file`
- `POST /v1/chunks/delete-file`
- `POST /v1/search`
- `POST /v1/read/chunk`
- `POST /v1/read/path`
- `POST /v1/stats`
- `POST /v1/optimize`
- `POST /v1/shutdown`

Import and replace accept JSON by default. They also accept Arrow IPC stream
bodies using `application/vnd.apache.arrow.stream`; metadata is then supplied
with `x-kbase-request-id`, `x-kbase-agent-key`, `x-kbase-generation-id`, and
for replace, `x-kbase-file-id`.

Generation validation returns `chunkIdDigest` and `fileIdDigest`. Each digest is
SHA-256 over sorted unique UTF-8 IDs, encoding every value as an unsigned
64-bit big-endian byte length followed by its raw bytes. `fileIdDigest` covers
only file IDs represented by at least one chunk in the Lance table.

The published LanceDB Rust API does not expose an `icu` FTS tokenizer in
v0.30.0. To preserve the KBASE contract, the sidecar segments both indexed text
and queries with ICU4X compiled data and stores the resulting tokens in a
LanceDB whitespace-tokenized FTS index.

Building the sidecar requires Rust 1.91 or newer and `protoc` on `PATH` (or the
`PROTOC`/`PROTOC_INCLUDE` variables expected by `prost-build`). These are build
requirements only; the packaged sidecar has no Rust or protoc runtime dependency.
## Release artifacts

This repository is intentionally maintained outside the Go runtime repository
and releases verified platform archives for Agent Platform.

Build one target on a runner with its Rust target, linker/SDK, `protoc`, and
Syft installed:

```bash
scripts/build-release.sh --os darwin --arch arm64
```

`--cargo-target-dir <dir>` 可指定可复用的 Cargo 编译缓存；Platform 的本地
同步脚本使用它避免每次重新编译 LanceDB 依赖。该缓存不是 release artifact，
不得发布或校验为发行包内容。

The command writes a versioned archive to `dist/v<version>/`. Each archive
contains the executable, `cargo-metadata.json`, `sbom.cdx.json`, and license
files. Agent Platform pins the archive SHA-256 for every supported target and
never builds this project during `make run` or program packaging.

Windows release runners use the matching PowerShell entrypoint:

```powershell
scripts/build-release.ps1 -TargetOS windows -TargetArch amd64
```
